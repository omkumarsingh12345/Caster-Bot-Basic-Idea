# Caster-Bot-Basic-Idea
This repository gives a basic understanding of our project "Caster Bot".

We have not initiated the actual project. This is just a pseudo structure so that you get an idea. 

Firstly we need to install the required libraries - OpenCV, pyttsx3, pytesseract, streamlit

These are the basic files to just understand the working of our project -

app.py - It reads the gameplay video frame by frame
events.py - It detects the text on screen using pytesseract 
commentary.py - We are using a simple dictionary of templates for the commentaries
tts engine.py - It is used for offline text to speech conversion 
streamlit.py - It will help us to create the UI of our project

So all these files should be collected in a folder named as "Caster Bot"
